# CON²PHYS: CONceptual CONsistency in ePHYS
## One dataset, one questionnaire, many truths

**CON²PHYS** is a collaborative study that aims to quantify how much -- or how little -- consensus exists among neuroscientists when interpreting fundamental 
in vivo electrophysiology concepts.  

The rationale behind this project is the suspicion that **system neuroscience** is becoming an ever-increasingly **fragmented field**.
Terms like “representation”, “functional connectivity” or "gamma oscillations" sound universal,
yet their definitions and implementations vary wildly depending on who you ask. 

Do these differences make a difference? That’s precisely the empirical question that CON²PHYS will answers.

We ask a set of seemingly straightforward, deliberately underspecified questions that tap map to core system neuroscience concepts. 
Participants answer by analyzing a single dataset with their own assumptions and pipelines. 
The goal is to reveal how individual analytical choices -- often arbitrary, often invisible -- might ultimately lead to different results while 
simulating how the community would typically answer a high-level scientific question. 

**Participation is open** to all neuroscientists with substantial prior system neuroscience experience regardless of the subdiscipline: 
from computational to cellular neuroscience, and everything in between.

Use the navigation tabs to learn how to take part, explore the dataset, read and submit the questionnaire, understand what you gain from contributing
(**co-authorship for ~30–50 hours of work**), and find out more about the two hackathons in which we pilot(ed) CON²PHYS.
